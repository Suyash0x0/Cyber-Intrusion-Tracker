# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Project

This project is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic, identifies malicious requests, and blocks the IPs of these requests. Itâ€™s built to demonstrate real-time detection with IP blocking, logging, and geolocation features.

## Features

- **Monitors Network Traffic**: Detects incoming requests.
- **Identifies Malicious IPs**: Uses a configurable threshold to flag IPs as malicious.
- **Blocks Malicious IPs**: Automatically blocks IPs exceeding the request threshold.
- **IP Logging**: Logs each detected malicious IP with a timestamp.
- **Geolocation of IPs**: Uses a GeoIP database to display location information for detected IPs.

## Project Structure

- `enhanced_ids.py`: The IDS script to be run on Laptop 1.
- `traffic_simulator.py`: Traffic generator script to simulate both normal and malicious traffic on Laptop 2.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for the project.
- `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`: GeoIP database file (download required).

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **Scapy**: `pip install scapy`
- **GeoIP Database**: [Download the GeoLite2 City database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) and place it in the project directory as `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IDS-Project.git
    cd IDS-Project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download and add the `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` file to the project directory for geolocation support.

## Usage

### 1. Run the IDS on Laptop 1

```bash
sudo python3 enhanced_ids.py <your-laptop-ip>
```

### 2. Run the Traffic Generator on Laptop 2

Replace `<target-ip>` with the IP address of Laptop 1.

```bash
python3 traffic_simulator.py <target-ip>
```

The IDS will monitor incoming traffic, marking malicious IPs in red and logging their geolocation.
